# Deep-learning-with-back-propagation

This is a c++ implementation of network for supervised classification. The followings are supported. 
	*Load an image dataset. The dataset is specified in a textfile of form : filename label
	*Objcted-oriented programming to implement layers:
		* Data loading layer

		* Fully connected layer

		* ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh activation layer

		* Softmax layer

		* Cross-Entropy classification loss

		* Accuracy layer

	* The network support inference and learning ( forward & backward operations )

# Required 
	
	* opencv 

# Usage
